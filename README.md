# ðŸ“© SMS Spam Detection using NLP and Machine Learning

This project is a classic **spam classification** task using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques like **TF-IDF** and **Bag of Words**, combined with **Machine Learning algorithms** such as **Multinomial Naive Bayes** and **Random Forest** to detect spam messages.
